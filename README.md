# Bayzat Frontend Assignment

In this exercise, you are given an existing code-base for a simple Movies application. You are expected to go over the items in the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section, make your changes in this repository, and follow the instructions in the [Submission](#submission) section to submit. 

If you have any questions, please send us an email, we'll get back to you as soon as possible. 

The task will take approximately two hours to complete, but you have two days to submit it.

## Installation & Running

### `yarn install`

This will download the dependencies that the project needs.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Evaluation 

In the provided source code under `src/` directory, please do the following tasks:

- fixing type issues
- performance improvements
- semantic elements
- apply best React practices
- components reusability
- fixing responsiveness
- repository cleanup (possible future issues and/or potential security issues)

You can use 3rd party libraries or pick any tool of your choice that might help you to make improvements. However, in this task, we don't expect you to spend too much time. Please leave fancy UI improvements aside and focus more on technical aspects. We don't require you to spend a lot of time on this task. For time-consuming activities, you can skip them and share as a feedback or code comment.

## Bonus

- clean commit history (trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices)
